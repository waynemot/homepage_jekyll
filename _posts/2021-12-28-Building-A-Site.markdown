Building a Jekyll website on the CSE server is easy.
This example uses the Jekyll basic 'blog' template, with modifications
to the particular layout elements to render as my personal home page.

This home page is hosted by the CSE server in my 'public_html' directory.


Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
