Building a Jekyll website on the School of Computing CSE server entails
starting with a Jekyll installation instance.
This example uses the Jekyll basic 'blog' template, with modifications
to the particular layout elements to render as my personal home page.
You can download a copy of the source code from my Github repository:

[https://github.com/waynemot/homepage_jekyll][git-project]

This home page is hosted by the CSE server in my 'public_html' directory.


Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
