## UNL School of Computing Homepage project
A University of Nebraska (UNL) 
School of Computing (SoC) homepage project implemented in Jekyll using external styling links.

The external styling used is provided by the UNL Web Developers Network, <wdn.unl.edu>, and
intends to loosely emulate the header. This includes reactive CSS responding to
dark-theme settings honored by browsers. Use of the styles provided by the UNL WDN
requires periodic update to the paths specified in the head.html include file,
so you may want to subscribe to their newsletter.

This project is intended for use by UNL faculty, students and staff associated
with the School of Computing. Other UNL organizations may use this project as needed.
